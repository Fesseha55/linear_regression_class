## Overview

Git is a **version control system** that tracks changes to your files over time. 

This tutorial covers the core Git workflow: **add**, **commit**, and **push**.

## The Model

Imagine the Git workflow as progressing through four stages. You control what happens at each stage:

```
Working Directory  →  Staging Area  →  Repository (Local)  →  Remote (GitHub)
      (edit)             (add)            (commit)               (push)
```

1. **Working Directory**: Where you edit files normally. This is just your Rstudio project. Maybe you add files, delete files, or change files. This occurs on your local computer. *If you want to save these changes to Git, eventually pushing to GitHub, you need to go through the next steps.*
2. **Staging Area**: A shopping cart is a good metaphor. You "add" the files you want to include in the next commit. These are just snapshots of your changes, which you should treat like a list of the things you routinely save. In many cases, this is everything you've changed in Rstudio.
3. **Local Repository**: Your personal history of saved snapshots. This is the local database on your computer that tracks all your commits. Each commit is like a version of your project at a specific point in time.
4. **Remote Repository**: The shared version on GitHub. This is where you "push" your local commits so others can see them on Github.

## Important Commands

### `git status` — Check What's Happening

Always start here. This command shows you:

- Which files have been modified
- Which files are staged (ready to commit)
- Which files are untracked (new files Git doesn't know about)

```bash
git status
```

**Example:**

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   lecture_gauss_markov.R

Untracked files:
  pol683Syllabus.R
```

### `git add` — Stage Your Changes

The `add` puts the items in the shopping cart, but you've not yet left the store.

```bash
# Add a specific file
git add analysis.R

# Add multiple specific files
git add analysis.R data_cleaning.R

# Add all changed files (use carefully!)
git add .
```

**Best Practice**: Add files individually or in small groups. Be careful with `git add .` unless you're certain you want to include everything. This can cause issues, particularly if you have large or sensitive data files. **Be sure to update your `.gitignore` file** to exclude files you don't want to track.**

### `git commit` — Save a Snapshot

The `commit` is like taking a photo of your shopping cart. It saves the staged changes to your local repository.  

```bash
git commit -m "Add regression analysis for Chapter 3 exercise"
```

**Anatomy of a good commit message:**

- **Short** 
- **Describe Changes** (not just "update" or "fix")
- **Descriptive**: Explains *what* and *why*, not *how*. ("Week 3 Lecture Slides - Add examples for Gauss-Markov assumptions" is better than "Added slides")

**Good:**

```bash
git commit -m "Fix typo in variance formula"
git commit -m "Add simulation for Gauss-Markov assumptions"
git commit -m "Update homework 2 with instructor feedback"
```

**Bad: **

```bash
git commit -m "stuff"
git commit -m "changes"
git commit -m ""
```

### `git push` — Include Changes on GitHub

The `push` command uploads your local commits to the remote repository (GitHub). You've now left the store....though I've clearly stretched this metaphor beyond its limits.

```bash
git push
```

If this is your first push on a new branch:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

## The Complete Workflow

Here's the typical sequence you'll use repeatedly:

```bash
# 1. Check current status
git status

# 2. Stage the files you want to commit
git add homework1.qmd

# 3. Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Complete homework 1 exercises"

# 4. Push to GitHub
git push
```

## Viewing History

### `git log` — See Commit History

```bash
# See recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# See commits with more detail
git log
```

### `git diff` — See What Changed

```bash
# See unstaged changes
git diff

# See staged changes
git diff --staged

# See changes in a specific file
git diff analysis.R
```

## Working with Branches

Branches let you work on features or experiments without affecting the main code.

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b homework-2

# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# List all branches
git branch
```

## Pull Requests (PRs)

A **pull request** is how you propose changes to a shared repository. It's a request to "pull" your changes into the main branch.

### Creating a Pull Request

1. Create a branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b my-class-contributions
   ```

2. Make changes, add, and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```

3. Push your branch to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin my-class-contributions
   ```

4. Go to GitHub and click "Compare & pull request"

5. Write a description of your changes and submit

### Commenting on Pull Requests

On GitHub, you can leave comments:

- **General comments**: In the "Conversation" tab
- **Line-specific comments**: Click the `+` next to any line of code in the "Files changed" tab
- **Review comments**: Click "Review changes" to approve, request changes, or comment

## Cloning a Repository

To get a copy of a repository onto your computer:

```bash
git clone <url>
```

**Example:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/crweber9874/linear_regression_class.git
cd linear_regression_class
```

This creates a local copy of the entire repository, including all history.

## Pulling Changes — Staying in Sync

Before you start working, **always pull the latest changes**:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

This downloads any commits from GitHub that you don't have locally.

**Practical Advice:** Always `pull` before you start working to avoid merge conflicts!

### The Daily Workflow

```bash
# 1. Pull latest changes from remote
git pull origin main

# 2. Make your changes to files
# (edit your code, data, etc.)

# 3. Stage and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Update analysis"

# 4. Push changes to remote
git push origin main
```
