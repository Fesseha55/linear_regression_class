This is Class of POL 682, in the department of Government and Public Policy PhD program. I am writing this short doc for checking up if it works. I can also edit it after a while. POL 682 is Taught by Professor Chris Weber. It is about Applied Regression analysis and Generalized Linear Models-combining a modern data analytic perspective with focus on applications in the Social Science. This class emphasis on models for categorical and count data-including time series regression, nonlinear regression, and non parametric regression.
Chapter one of the text book teaches about Statistical Model and Social science, Chapter two Regression Analysis, Chapter 3- Examining data, and Chapter 4 - transforming data.
